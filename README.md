# PCA_EEG
MATLAB App implementing a Principal Component Analysis

This App provides interfaces for both segmenting EEG signals as well as viewing and altering the weight the average signal, as well as individual signals. Both specific segments as well as channels may be selected. Sliders may be used to change the weights of the factors, altering the signal display real time. The contribution individual factors, may also be displayed, as well as the original signal.

Please check the SingleEEGPCA1_3.mlapp file for more information and dependencies.

Example of an occular artifact (a change in signal resulting from eye movements):
